## Computer Virus
1. A computer virus is a kind of malicious computer program that can replicate itself when executed.
2. When the replication is done, this program infacts other files andf programs present in the computer.
3. Computer virus get in through CD's, pendrive ,internet , etc.

## Phishing
Phishing attacks are the practice of  sending fraudulant communication that appears to comr from reputable source. 

The goal is to steal the sensitive data .

## Denial of Service Attack (DoS Attack)
A DoS Attack is a tactic of overloading a machine or network to ake it unavailable to actual user's.

Attacker can aschive this by sending the more traffic or request to the target machine that can handle , causing it to fail.

## Email Spoofing
Email spoofing is the act of sending email with a  forged sender address. It tricks the receipent into thinking that someone they know or trust has sent them email.

1. A spoofed email is one that appears to originate from one source but actullay has been sent from another or fake source.

2. The email service provider needs to implement additional measures to counter email spoofing like :
    * Sender Policy Framework(SPF)
    * Domain key identifed mail(DKIM)
    * Reporting and Conformance

## Email Spamming
+ Spamming is the use of electronic messaging system like email,text message etc to send or broadcast unwanted messages to the large group of people.

* This occurs when someone forcefully takes control of website (by cracking password and letter chnageing it).
* The actual owner of the website does not have any control over what appears on the website.
* For cracking password there are two ways:
  * Brute Force Attack
  * Dictionory Attack
## How does Web Jacking takes place?
* The admin of any website has a username and password that only he only may use to upload files or content in the website.
* Ideally the password remain secret with the admin.
* If a hacker can take hold of username and password , it can pretend to be admin and change the content of the site.

# Computer Network Intrusions
* A network intrusion is any illegal activity that is carried out in a digital network.
* The CN intrusion always effect tghe security of data and network.
* To deal with network intrusions, organization must have cyber security team to detect and prevent from intrusion.
* Computer network intrusion are done to:
    * Steal or destory personal information.
    * Attack are made to obtain access to internal system.
    * Financial loss to organizations.
* To save the network from harmful activity. Intrusion Detaction Systm(IDS) need to be installed in network or system.

### Computer Network Intrusion Attack Techniques:
1. Multi Routing
* This method is alos call Assymatric routing. In this technique, intruder use multiple routes to intrude target devices or network.
* This allows them to  avoiding the detectedby intrusion detaction systm as most of the packages in the network are suspicious some packets bypass certain network system.

2. Buffer Overflow Attack
* In this tachnique, the intruder override any specific part of computer memory of target devices.
* This intruder insert harmful commands, which when execute causes harmful effect to the computer.
* To prevent this effact, network designer need to install Boundry Checking Logic that identifies and block executable code to be written in the memory.

3. Protocol Specific Attack
* To transmit data from one computer to another, computer need to follow certain set of rules. The set of rules are called protocols.
* Some protocols are ARP,IP,TCP,UDP,SMTP,etc.
* This protocol has certain loopholes which gives chance fro intruder to attack.
eg: SMTP Protocol- used in mailing,and ARP protocol does not provide any authentication machenism.

4. Traffic Flooding
* In this technique , attacker create too large traffic which can not be handle by network sysytm .This would then create confusion and congetion in network environment as a result some unauthenticated packages can be bypass intrusion sensors.

## Identity Theft

## Virtual Crime
* The increasing popularity of online world or virtual world (Metaverse)lead to the debate of wheather ther are such things as virtual crime.
* The virtual crime has evolved from relatively basic text based virtual community to huge and popularity graphic based online AVTAR games such as "Second life" and "World of war wraft"
* Given the millions of people are participating in online forums it gives room to crime people can harm , abuse eact other avtars.
* The issues first comes to the piture some year ago , in an online community - LambdaMOO -> text baed virtual community where members can create their own character and interact with text based commands.
In this game one character "Mr Bungle" Spoofed several players and provoked most of the player to engade in voilent sex acts and making it appears that they are doing it volentiarily. This incident gives rises to whether such conduct shouklfd be representes as virtual crime .

  * Virtual rape
  * Virtual Murder
  * Offenses against property virtual propers
* In games like "Second life " people buy or sell virtual property what if someone frocefully try to occupy it?
## Session Hijacking
* Session hijacking is also known as TCP session hijacking.
* It is a mthod of taking over a web user session by secretly obtaining the Session ID and act as authorized user.After obtaining Session ID an attacker can do anything that authorized user is allowed to do on th network.
*  The atatcker can get access to server without having to authenticat to it. 

#### Wht session HIjacking is sucessfull
* Insecure way of handling session ID Session ID is transmitted over the network without any encryption machenism.Once attacker gains access to session ID it can directly be used.
* The current session ID generation algorithm are weak, so it become easy for attacker to predict next session ID.
* Once the attacker hijacks the session they no longer have to worry about authenticating to the server as long as communication session remains active . There is no auto timeout.
* The account does not get locked out ndue to invalid session ID.

#### Session Hijacking Process
* Sniffing into active session : Actacker captures the traffic and tries to gather iformation about the session.
* Monitor the traffic for vunerable protocols and fine any vaild authentication  packets passing through.
* Session ID Retrival and Prediction.
* Session Desynchronization with victim.
* Take over the session and maintain connection
